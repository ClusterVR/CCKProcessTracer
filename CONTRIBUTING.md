# Pull Requests

5. Create a Pull Request from the feature branch of the fork to the develop branch of CCKProcessTracer in the ClusterVR namespace
6. Follow the template and link the Issue when creating the Pull Request
7. Discussions on the proposal will take place in the Issue or Pull Request
8. Approval or rejection
9. If the proposal is approved, the Pull Request will be merged by the maintainers of CCKProcessTracer, and the Issue will be closed

For minor changes like spelling corrections that are likely to be merged, you can simplify the process as follows:

1. Fork CCKProcessTracer under the ClusterVR namespace
2. Make the proposed changes in the fork
3. Create a Pull Request from the feature branch of the fork to the develop branch of CCKProcessTracer in the ClusterVR namespace

# Bug Reporting

Basic steps for reporting a bug:

**If you are about to report a security-related bug, do not create an Issue but contact devrel@cluster.mu directly.**

Security-related bugs include:

- Suspected access to other users' information
- Suspected access to other users' creations

For regular bug reports, create an Issue by filling in the following items:

- The version or revision you are using
- The OS and CPU architecture of your runtime environment
- The actions you were taking when the bug occurred
- What behavior you were expecting originally
- What the actual behavior was

If you're unsure whether it's a bug, first use [the Creator Community on Discord](https://discord.gg/bdNkPSHM) .

# Proposals

CCKProcessTracer aims to be a tool that visualizes complex CCK gimmicks and lowers the barrier to creating and sharing CCK gimmicks.

Basic steps for making new feature or specification change proposals:

1. Check if the content you want to propose has already been discussed in past Issues
2. If there is no relevant Issue, create a new one
3. Fill in the Issue template
4. Join the discussion

# Code Reviews

Code reviews in CCKProcessTracer are conducted approximately once every 1-2 weeks by the core team or any member of the developer community.
If the Pull Request is ready to be merged without feedback, it will be merged; otherwise, the reviewers will wait for the response of the Pull Request creator.
If there is no response within about 3 weeks, the relevant Pull Request will be closed.

# Community

CCKProcessTracer is supported by the developer community.
Casual discussions and proposals might be easier in [the Creator Community on Discord](https://discord.gg/bdNkPSHM), so feel free to utilize it.
